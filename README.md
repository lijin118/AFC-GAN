# AFC-GAN
Alleviating Feature Confusion for Generative Zero-shot Learning, ACM Multimedia 2019

Source code for AFC-GAN published in ACM MM 2019. The paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07615

This project handles the feature confusion issue in zero-shot learning and generalized zero-shot learning, especially these methods based on generative models. The main contributions are:  
1) For the first time, we explicitely point out the feature confusion issue.  
2) We propse an effective way to handle the issue.  
3) We prose a metric to quantify the feature confusion.  


The code is based on pytorch, you can run demo.sh and have fun with ZSL!
